# csc690project
For this project, I wanted to make an office hour scheduler app to ease the difficulty of scheduling with a professor. 
I originally did a project similar to this using web dev tools, but I was also interested in creating one on the phone.
I had many functionalities that I wanted to include, but failed to implement because I had limited knowledge on the subject.  
  
  The functions that I was able to implement
    1. Add alloted times to core data that was viewable by both student and teachers/professors.
    2. Functional UI.  
    
    
  The teacher side of things that was failed to implement.
    1. Be able to auto delete schedules from core data that had passed.
    2. Reject student appointments, due to some issues that may have occured for the teachers/professors.
    3. Add that schedule appointment to a calendar.
    4. Ease of time selection for teachers/professors.
    5. Login function
    
  The student side of things that was failed to implement.
    1. Be able to sign up for an appointment that appeared in notifications.
    2. Add that scheduled appointment to a calendar.
    3. Login function
