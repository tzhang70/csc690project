# csc690project
For this project, I wanted to make an office hour scheduler app to ease the difficulty of scheduling with a professor. 
I originally did a project similar to this using web dev tools, but I was also interested in creating one on the phone.
I had many functionalities that I wanted to include, but failed to implement because I had limited knowledge on the subject.  
  

  Must Have:
    1. Teachers are able to add times.
    2. Teachers are able to delete times.
    3. Students are able to add times.
    
  Nice to Have:
    1. Login
    2. Register
    3. Have QOL for choosing times. 
    4. Be able to auto delete schedules from core data that had passed.
    5. Add that schedule appointment to a calendar.
